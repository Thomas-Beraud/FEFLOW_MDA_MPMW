# Doctorat_INRS

This repo contains the developments of my PhD

- Ensemble Assimilation Method applied to environnemental and hydrogeological studies

- An new tool to assign weight in the updating process based on distance and variance around observation point

- A way to assign a weight in function of different geological properties / region / stationnarity

- Tools to assist the interface between FeFlow (and every x,y,z format parameters input for simulation process) and Ensemble Method Assimilation
