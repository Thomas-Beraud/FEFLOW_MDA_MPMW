# Doctorat_INRS

This repo contains the developments of my PhD

- Ensemble Assimilation Methods applied to environnemental and hydrogeological studies

- An new tool to assign weight in the updating process based on distance and variance around observation point

- A way to assign a weight in function of different geological properties / region / stationnarity / wells

- Tools to assist the interface between FeFlow (and every x,y,z format parameters input for simulation process) and Ensemble Method Assimilation

- A batch method to automatically assign and run all models of an ensemble through FEFLOW


Data are not included with this repo. All the ideas and implementation are detailled, an exemple of utilisation is given in the two jupyter files.
